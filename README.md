# Corey Dalton SNHU CS 499 ePortfolio

## Self-Assessment

Completing my coursework throughout the program and developing this ePortfolio has helped to showcase my strengths and understanding of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. I have also gained important understanding and practice in security, collaborating in a team environment, and communicating to stakeholders. Specifically in this ePortfolio, I was able to showcase my proficiency in regards to programming in C++, Java, and SQL languages. 

During the time I was enrolled in the CS-250 Software Development Lifecycle course here at SNHU, I was able to become practiced and gain a solid understanding of the importance of collaborating in a team environment and communicating to stakeholders. During that course, I was able to assume the role of, as well as work with others assuming the roles of different members of an agile development team. These roles included the scrum master, product owner, tester, and developer. The time spent in that course and the lessons learned really showed me the importance of the different roles of a development team and how crucial it is to work together, including the communication to stakeholders of the project, in order to meet deadlines and requirements of the project and customer. As a whole, all of the courses that I was enrolled in here at SNHU that were directly related to Computer Science pushed the importance and gave me a growing understanding of software design and engineering.

The CS-260 course here at SNHU provided me with a quality understanding of data structures and algorithms. I was introduced to the uses of linked-lists and search algorithms, hash tables and hashing algorithms, vector sorting, hash tables, binary search trees, and chaining algorithms, among other programming skills and techniques. Learning and practicing these different types of data structures and algorithms was key to understanding the importance of data organization in software development and how algorithms are incredibly helpful in saving time, energy, and resources. 

The CS-340 Client/Server Development course gave me a more developed understanding of databases and security than what I already had. This course, specifically, introduced me to working with databases in MongoDB and securing them so only specific users with credentials and authentication tokens were able to access and modify the databases. Being able to work with a database and alter it is a great skill to have, but if there is no security and if anyone who is able to access the database is able to manipulate it can be a huge problem. Security is key to safekeeping information in databases, as well as all other aspects of software development, so it needs to be a primary focus with any major project before releasing to the public or anyone who should not have access to manipulate the data or source code to protect the team and intellectual property of the creators. 

For this ePortfolio, I decided to include three different artifacts â€“ one for each category that was incorporated. Of course, I could have chosen a single artifact to show enhancements with for each category, but I felt that using three different would be a good way to break it up and really showcase my skills and understanding of the three different categories of software design and engineering, data structures and algorithms, and databases. The artifacts that I included are from projects that I worked on throughout my enrollment here at SNHU, as well as when I was enrolled in another computer programming degree program at another college. 

### [Software Design & Engineering](SoftwareDesign&Engineering.md)
A simple C++ grading program that has been converted to a Java program.

### [Data Structures & Algorithms](Algorithms&DataStructure.md)
A C++ program that renders two 3D objects that was enhanced to include a rotational aspect so that all sides of the objects could be viewed.

### [Databases](Databases.md)
A SQL database that is enhanced by removing data from a specific table, dropping that table, and then re-creating the table to include another important field that was left out originally.
